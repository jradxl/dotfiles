#!/bin/bash
#
# logrotate_one [options] {logrotate.d_file}
#
# Run the logrotate against a single sub-configuration file, while also
# defining the global settings from /etc/logrotate.conf
#
# For example verbose the log rotation of the 'samba' logs
#   logrotate_one samba
# Or debugging (dryrun) of the sssd files
#   logrotate_one -d sssd
#
# This is needed because "logrotate" does not have any option to limit what it
# rotates, and rotating using a sub-configuration file directly will NOT
# include any 'global' settings.   The "logrotate" command only allows you to
# use configuration from a REAL file, not pipelines or other special files.
# Basically it is hard to work with.
#
# The logrotate -v flag is enabled by default.
#
####
#
# ASIDE: As a helpful hint I sometimes find it good to force a log rotation
# by editing the file "/var/lib/logrotate/logrotate.status" and changing
# the date of the last rotation to the previous year.  While there I would
# also often delete log file entries that no longer exist.
#
# Extra hint.  Sort the "logrotate.status" file, but keep the first line
# as the first line, It makes it a lot easier to find the log files you are
# looking for. Log rotate does not care about the file order, and will even
# scramble the order again next time it runs.
